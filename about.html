<p>I’m originally from in a town of 680 people in northern Minnesota (60 miles south of the Canadian border). </p>
<p>I moved to Duluth, MN in 2006 to complete my BS degree in Biology from the University of Minnesota. </p>
<p>In 2009, I got the opportunity to travel to Europe to attend a microbiology study abroad program. The trip was about a month and a half and everything I needed for the entire trip fit into my backpack. This experience was definitely an important step in my life and made it so much easier picking up and moving to another state.</p>
<p>I moved to Denver, CO in 2010 and started an internship at Forensic Laboratories. I got this internship by cold calling about 20 laboratories and asking if they needed an extra hand. Only one lab called me back and that basically started my laboratory career. Moving to Colorado was a huge personal level-up for me and the first time I was truly “on my own”. It’s liberating. </p>
<p>3 months at Forensic Laboratories, I became the assistant lab administrator and I was emerged in the quality and regulatory aspects of running a large commercial laboratory. It’s a little crazy, that only once (and I mean one time) do I remember hearing about the clinical laboratory as a professional in college. I really didn’t even know it existed. Its probably why there is such a shortage of medical technologists out there. </p>
<p>In 2013, I attended the Colorado Center for Medical Laboratory Science to obtain my certification in Clinical Laboratory Science.  This is a post-baccalaureate program which allows individuals to be certified through the ASCP (American Society of Clinical Pathology). Oddly enough, this was the same time I became “serious” about being the best oil painter I could be. I like to bite off more than I can chew. On the weekends when I was in school, I paint when I finished studying.</p>
<p>After graduating in 2013, I started working as a clinical laboratory scientist at the University of Colorado Hospital in their molecular and virology laboratory. I remember being so thrilled about this, the University of Colorado Hospital is a one of the premiere academic research institutions in the country. This was also the time I took lessons at the Student Arts League of Denver and further my painting journey. </p>
<p>In 2015, I was offered a position at Sonic Healthcare USA in Austin, TX as a Corporate Quality Manager. This was an amazing promotion and a chance to live in one of US Today’s  “best places to live in the US”. This is actually the place where I got my first taste of web design. I was tasked to create a “Quality Intranet” page that would be central hub for quality for the Sonic Healthcare USA. It was a very basic webpage built on Microsoft SharePoint, but I really enjoyed making it and I wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>Staying in the Sonic Healthcare family, I transition to the Quality Manger & Quality Coordinator for a small esoteric laboratory called Sonic Reference Laboratory. Around this time, I took private painting lessons with Mark Carder. His one-on-one instructions have taught me so much about color mixing, tones and values. Highly recommend. I still remain in contact with him and visit his studio downtown when I can.</p>
<p>In November of 2015, I step-up my fitness game and started crossfit at Jääkarhu (yes, I drank the Kool-Aid...and it was good.). This has been so amazing. I’ve met amazing people and made so many good friends. I currently work out there 4 times a week, in addition to my long runs around Lady Bird Lake on Saturdays. Fitness is something that is very important to me, its keep me disciplined, focused and happy. </p>
<p>In October of 2016, I attended the UT Coding Bootcamp at Austin and really learned what you could do with a web page. This was so much fun (and hard work). Web development is amazing. I love building and creating pages. It combines technical skills with creativity. I love that! Its perfect for the science and artist guy like myself.</p>
<p>I’m currently still working at Sonic Reference Laboratory as the Quality Coordinator and still designing web applications (and painting). I’m currently working on the SRL website for the VP of Sales and Marketing and its coming along nicely. Also, I will be working an app with one of my friends from Jääkarhu, who coincidently I am also painting a portrait of!</p>
